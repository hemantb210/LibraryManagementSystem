# LibraryManagementSystem
Library Management System using Spring Boot
This project uses JPA and Hibernate to create a library management system that stores and retrieves details of books and users using API calls.
A User can issue books and the date of issue and date of return both are automatically added to the database depending on the date issue or return is done.
The fine on late return can also be easily displayed.
